# Week 3 — GPIO Output (LED Control)

## Goals
- Safely control GPIO output on Raspberry Pi 5
- Learn breadboard wiring fundamentals
- Use gpiozero for hardware abstraction

## What I Built
- A script that turns an LED on for a fixed time
- A command-driven script to turn an LED on/off interactively

## Concepts Learned
- GPIO pin numbering (BCM)
- Power vs ground
- Why resistors are required
- Hardware state control
- gpiozero vs legacy GPIO libraries

## Hardware Used
- Raspberry Pi 5
- Breadboard
- LED
- 220Ω resistor
- Jumper wires
