Structured learning plan for Raspberry Pi, Python, and robotics projects. 

# Robotics Learning Portfolio

Hi, I'm Damien. I'm building a structured path toward working in robotics using a Raspberry Pi 5.

## Goals
- Learn Python for robotics
- Learn Linux workflows used in engineering
- Build hardware + software projects (GPIO, sensors, motors)
- Transition into ROS 2 and perception later

## Hardware
- Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB)
- Breadboard + jumper wires
- (Add sensors/motor drivers as you buy them)

## Progress
- Week 1: Python basics
- Week 2: Linux + tooling
- Week 3: GPIO output
- Week 4: GPIO input

## How this repo is organized
Each folder is one week with:
- code/
- wiring notes or diagrams (when relevant)
- a README explaining what I built and learned
